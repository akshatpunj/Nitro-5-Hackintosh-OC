#### Supports MacOS 11.X

## Whats not working:

- HDMI ðŸ˜ª (won't work because hdmi port is hardwired into GeForceÂ® GTX 1660Ti). Don't worry read the note
- Nvidia GeForceÂ® GTX 1660Ti

<br/>

## Note:

If you still want to use an external monitor, you can buy a USB3.0 to HDMI adapter.

[Here is a good one](https://www.amazon.in/USB-3-0-HDMI-Adapter-Converter/dp/B07TTCP37B/)
